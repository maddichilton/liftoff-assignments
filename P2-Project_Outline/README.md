### Overview
This is an organizational app for remote journalism work that allows users to upload, edit and claim assignments. Instead of articles and assignments being tracked independently by writers and editors, the app allows unclaimed or theoretical assignments to be uploaded to a dashboard where they can be claimed, and claimed assignments to be displayed with description and deadlines in a calendar where they can be referenced.

### Features
<p>User login: users can create profiles (split into editor or writer positions, with editors having more functionality) and log into their accounts.</p>
<p>Create assignment: assignments can be created and placed on a calendar (by editors) or proposed (by writers) to be approved by an editor.</p>
<p>Claim assignment: writers and editors can claim open assignments and enter deadlines.</p>
<p>Filter claimed/unclaimed: sorts assignments by claimed/unclaimed for ease of use.</p>
<p>View current work on user profile: user profile should have brief identifying information, with an easy way to view current assignments and deadlines (priority) and past or proposed assignments.</p>

### Technologies
<p>Java</p>
